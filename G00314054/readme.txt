Readme for my String comparison service project.

This project will compile and run. However after inputting the 2 strings and clicking the compare button, the program will hang for about 8-10 seconds and then throw a 
notserializableexception. I am not not sure what causes this exception although it clams to result from the Result File.I will still upload this though.
